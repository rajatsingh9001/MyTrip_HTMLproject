    <h2 style="text-align: center; ">Kyoto, Japan</h2>
    <span id="span-text">
        <p>Kyoto (/ˈkjoʊtoʊ/;[4] Japanese: 京都, Kyōto [kʲoꜜːto] (About this soundlisten)), officially Kyoto City (京都市,
            Kyōto-shi, [kʲoːtoꜜɕi] (About this soundlisten)), is the capital city of Kyoto Prefecture in Japan. Located
            in the Kansai region on the island of Honshu, Kyoto forms a part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area along
            with Osaka and Kobe. As of 2018, the city had a population of 1.47 million.</p>

        <p>In 794, Kyoto (then known as Heian-kyō) was chosen as the new seat of Japan's imperial court. The original
            city was arranged in accordance with traditional Chinese feng shui following the model of the ancient
            Chinese capital of Chang'an. The Imperial Palace faced south, resulting in Ukyō (the right sector of the
            capital) being on the west while Sakyō (the left sector) is on the east. The streets in the modern-day wards
            of Nakagyō, Shimogyō, and Kamigyō-ku still follow a grid pattern.</p>

        <p>The emperors of Japan ruled from Kyoto in the following eleven centuries until 1869, when the court relocated
            to Tokyo. The city was devastated during the Ōnin War in the 15th century and went into an extended period
            of decline, but gradually revived under the Tokugawa shogunate (1600–1868) and flourished as a major city in
            Japan. The modern municipality of Kyoto was established in 1889. The city was spared from large-scale
            destruction during World War II and as a result, its prewar cultural heritage has mostly been preserved.</p>

        <p>Kyoto is considered the cultural capital of Japan and a major tourist destination. It is home to numerous
            Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, palaces and gardens, some of which are listed collectively by UNESCO as a
            World Heritage Site. Prominent landmarks include the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kiyomizu-dera, Kinkaku-ji,
            Ginkaku-ji and the Katsura Imperial Villa. Kyoto is also a center of higher learning, with Kyoto University
            being an institution of international renown.</p>
